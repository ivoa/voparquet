# VOParquet

This document is an IVOA Note describing best practice for use of
Parquet in the [Virtual Observatory](http://www.ivoa.net/).

Its main focus is the specification of a convention for associating
rich metadata with Parquet files by storing a data-less VOTable
document in the parquet footer.

To build a PDF version this document, you will need a reasonably
complete LaTeX installation, a sufficiently capable `make`, preferably
[latexmk](https://personal.psu.edu/~jcc8/software/latexmk/).
For further
details, see [ivoatexDoc](https://ivoa.net/documents/Notes/IVOATex/).

Alternatively, for now you can probably find a recent/current version of the
built document here:
[votable.pdf](https://www.star.bristol.ac.uk/mbt/voparquet/voparquet.pdf) and
[votable.html](https://www.star.bristol.ac.uk/mbt/voparquet/voparquet.html).
